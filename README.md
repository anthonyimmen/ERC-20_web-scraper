# Overview
This was my final project for my Blockchains and Cryptocurrencies class. For the project I conducted research within my decided topic and drafted a 12 page research paper over this topic and presented my research. This repo contains the research paper, presentation, and web scraper that I created to assist in my research.

# ERC-20_web-scraper
Created a web-scraper to pull ERC-20 token names and their 7 day transfer totals. These two data sets are then graphed against each other matplotlib.

This web-scraper is built to run on https://bloxy.info/list_tokens/ERC20?page=1

It has the functionality to run on all pages 1-50 by changing the range in the for loop on line 10. (axes might overflow into each other for the more pages pulled in)

Enjoy!
